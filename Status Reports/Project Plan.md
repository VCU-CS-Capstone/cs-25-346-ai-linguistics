**Project: Artificial Intelligence / Deep Learning / Machine Learning / Linguistics / Acoustics**

**Project Description:** This project spans 9 months and is focused on developing advanced live captioning and transcription technologies for communication that is done over radio in military enviorments. It addresses the challenges of applying these technologies in noisy, real-world defense environments. The repository will contain all relevant data, source code, documentation, and other resources created and collected throughout the duration of the project. This includes datasets, machine learning models, and scripts used for testing, training, and deployment.

**Problem Definition:**

In enviorments with heavy backround noise, disruptions, and unusual vocabulary current techonolgies that process audio and output text are lacking in their ability to perform accuartly. Our team plans to use OpenAI's Whisper model and train it on a uniqe data set that will allow for accurate transcription in noisy military enviorments. 

**Deliverables**

1. Set up whisper model on VCU HPR cluser.
2. Obtain a labeled dataset that includes audio from both clean and noisy enviorments. This data set may include synthetic noisy audio if naturally noisy audio is hard to collect.
3. User interface that provides an easy, visually appealing way to interact with the trained whisper model and quickly obtain accurate transcriptions.

**Coding Plan**

| Week | Tasks | Goals |
|------|-------|-------|
| Week 5 | Meet with Army mentor. | Figure out the project specifications. |
| Week 10 | Set up whisper model on cluster, respond to army mentor about collecting data | Reach out to professor cano |
